== About me
I am currently a Ph.D student at [https://www.sysu.edu.cn/ Sun Yat-sen University], where I am supervised by [http://www.zibinzheng.com/ Prof. Zibin Zheng] and [https://jiachi-chen.github.io/ Dr. Jiachi Chen]. I also play Smart Contract CTF and bug hunting competitions (e.g., Code4rena) for fun.

My research interests include: 
- Security of Blockchain and Smart Contract
- Fuzzing
